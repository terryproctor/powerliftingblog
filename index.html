            <h3>Why blog at all?</h3>
                <p>I've started this blog for a few reasons:
                    <ol>
                        <li>I code in my freetime and need a project to work on.</li>
                        <li>As a journal for my lifts.</li>
                        <li>To comment on how training has changed since Covid-19.</li>
                    </ol>
                    Things have definitely changed a lot this year. As I live and train in Scotland, I’ve been not training for more than 6 months.
                    At the start of the year I was competing in my first competition and intermediate training.The training before the competition was the hardest I’ve ever done, and I got some new personal bests as a result.
