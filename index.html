            <h3>Why blog at all?</h3>
                <p>I've started this blog for a few reasons:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>I code in my freetime and need a project to work on.</li>
                        <li>As a journal for my lifts.</li>
                        <li>To comment on how training has changed since Covid-19.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Things have definitely changed a lot this year. As I live and train in Scotland, I’ve been not training for more than 6 months.
                    At the start of the year I was competing in my first competition and intermediate training.The training before the competition was the hardest I’ve ever done, and I got some new personal bests as a result.

            <h3>End of Linear Progression</h3>
            
                <p>After two months of going back to linaer progression (Starting Strength), I've decided jump to a Intermediate program</p>
                <p>Maybe it's my old age but my hips aren't taking the punishment of LP very well. Squatting three times a week is getting to me.</p>
                <p>Also my bench press and overhead press are starting to fail</p>
                <ul>My lifts after LP (1RM) are:
                <p> </p>
                    <li>Squat: 156kg</li>
                    <li>Bench Press: 79kg</li>
                    <li>Deadlift: 169kg</li>
                    <li>Overhead Press: 59kg</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is a long way from my previous bests. But since lockdown has forced me to not train for just over half a year, this isn't bad.</p>
                <p>I briefly did Wendler's 531 for a week then realised the volume was way too low. So I'm currently doing Madcow 5x5.</p>
